The uhidvkbdd daemon is a simple way to get media keys on some keyboards
working in X11. Such keyboards present separate interfaces: a basic USB
keyboard which is handled by the kernel ukbd(4) driver and a USB HID
device that reports the media keys which is handled by the generic
uhid(4) driver.  uhidvkbdd reads consumer control inputs from the latter
and translates them via vkbd(4) into conventional media keyboard scan-
codes, which are mapped in X11 by default.
